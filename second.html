         <h1><u>1. Who developed<a href="https://www.python.org/about/"> Python</a> and when?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS.Python was developed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.</p> <hr>

         <h1><u>2. What is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">Programming language</a>?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS.1. A <b>programming language </b>is a formal system of instructions used to communicate with a computer.<br>
2. Enables developers to write programs for various tasks such as web development, data analysis, and automation.<br>
3. <b>Examples:</b> C, Java, Python, JavaScript.</p><hr>

         <h1><u>3.What is syntax in<a href="https://www.python.org/about/"> Python</a>?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS.Syntax refers to the rules and structure of how Python code must be written, like indentation, keywords, and punctuation.</p><hr>
   
         <h1><u>4. What is<a href="https://www.python.org/about/"> Python</a>?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS 1. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. a. Monty Python’s Flying Circus<br>
2. Older than Java (1995).</p><hr>
      
          <h1><u>5.Is Python <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity">case-sensitive</a>?</u></h1>
          <p>ANS.Yes, Python is case-sensitive. For example, Variable and variable are considered different.</p><hr>

         <h1><u>6.What are the main <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-language-advantages-applications/" >advantages </a>of Python?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS:Easy to learn and use<br>
Simple and readable syntax<br>
Large standard library<br>
Huge community support<br>
Cross-platform (works on Windows, Linux, Mac)<br>
Supports multiple programming paradigms (OOP, functional, procedural)</p><hr>

         <h1><u>7.<a href="https://jaydevs.com/top-companies-that-use-python/">Companies</a> using Python?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS.Google, Netflix, Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox, NASA, Uber, Reddit, IBM, 10000 coders dashboard </p><hr>

         <h1><u>8.Why is Python called an <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/why-python-is-called-interpreted-language/">interpreted language</a>?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS. Because Python code is executed line-by-line by the Python interpreter at runtime, instead of being compiled into machine code first.</p><hr>

         <h1><u>9.Python<a href="https://intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/python-tutorial/fundamentals-of-python/"> Fundamentals</a>:?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS1.<b>Variables</b><br>
a. A variable is a container. Called a variable because we can change the value of a variable.<br>
b. Snake Case for variables ( using _’s), Pascalcase for class names, All caps for constants<br>
c. There are no constants in python. You can only show your intention by writing All Capital letters.</p><hr>
         
         <h1><u>10.<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp">DataTypes</a>?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS a.<b> Built In data types:</b><br>
i. Numeric – int, float, complex, bool<br>
ii. Sequence Type – string, list, tuple, Range<br>
1. There are no characters in Python. They are also strings<br>
iii. Mapping Type – dictionary (Key and Value pairs)<br>
iv. Set Type – Set<br>
v. None</p><hr>
 
 
         <h1><u>11.What makes Python a good choice for beginners?</u></h1>
         <p>Simple and clean syntax<br>
English-like commands<br>
Requires fewer lines of code<br>
Lots of tutorials and community help available</p><hr>
